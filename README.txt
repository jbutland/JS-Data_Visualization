JS Data Visualization ingests .CSV files of survey data and outputs interactive JavaScript based charts via shortcode.

== Description ==
JS Data Visualization ingests .CSV files of survey data and outputs interactive JavaScript based charts via shortcode. This plugin utilizes Chartjs and WordPress Plugin Boilerplate. The admin panel currently allows one chart to be generated per .csv file and assigns a shortcode accordingly. Chart type for each question is currently limited to Bar, Line, or Pie, and is also currently assignable in the admin section. This plugin is currently still experimental and as such is distributed \"As Is\"

== Installation ==
